# Emerging-Tech-JuypterNotesbooks

My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 4th year student at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development.

For my Emerging Technologies module, I was asked to create a set of [Jupyter-Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) 
explaining and demonstrating some of the packages used by the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

The packages I was asked to study are:
## Numpy random notebook: 
A Jupyter Notebook explaining the concepts
behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots
of the various distributions. 

## Iris dataset notebook:
 A Jupyter Notebook explaining the famous
iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate
the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.

## MNIST dataset notebook: 
A Jupyter Notebook explaining how to
read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

## Digit recognition script: 
A Python script that takes an image file
containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised
learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

## Digit recognition notebook: 
A Jupyter Notebook explaining how the
above Python script works and discussing its performance.

## Starting a note book: 
In order to run Jupyter Notbooks I had to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)
Distribution, which is a free and open-source Python distribution with lots of pre-installed packages including Jupyter.

Once you have installed Anaconda, open a command line and navagate to where you want the notebook to be saved and run the command "jupyter notebook" and the Jupyter home page will open in your browser, then click the new button on the top right side, select "python 3" and a new notebook will open.
